### BACKEND ###
+ 🔒 Authentication (Auth Controller)
- Handles signup, login, and token generation. Uses JWT for authentication and sets secure HTTP-only cookies. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt. Fetches data from the request body, validates user data (checks if already registered), verifies passwords for existing users, generates JWT tokens, creates authentication cookies, and sends a response back to the client.

+ 🎓 Course Management (Course Controller)
- Allows instructors to create and manage courses. Validates course data, uploads thumbnails to Cloudinary, and updates relevant schemas. Ensures each course is linked to instructors and categories. Processes the request body to extract necessary details, including the course thumbnail. Course data is validated to ensure no fields are left empty. Images are uploaded to Cloudinary for optimized storage. A new course entry is then created in the database, added to the instructor’s user schema, and the Category schema is updated accordingly. Finally, a response is sent back confirming the successful creation of the course.

+ 🔁 Password Reset
- ResetPassword Controller: The system first retrieves the email address from the request body and checks whether a user exists for that email. If the user is found, an email verification process is initiated. A token is generated and stored in the user’s record along with an expiration time. A reset URL is created and sent to the user's email, informing them that their password reset request has been successfully processed.

- ResetPasswordToken Controller: Responsible for verifying and processing the password reset request. It fetches the data from the request body, validates it, and retrieves the user details from the database using the provided token. The token's expiration time is checked, after which the new password is hashed and updated in the database. Finally, a response is sent to confirm the password change.

+ 🗂️ Category Management
- Create Category: Data is fetched from the request body, validated, and stored in the database as a new entry. Once completed, a response is sent to the instructor confirming the successful creation of the category.
- Show All Categories: Retrieves all categories from the database, including their names and descriptions, and returns them in the response.
- Category Page Details: Fetches details of a specific category, including its associated courses, other available categories, and the top-selling courses based on enrollments.

+ 💳 Payment Integration
- Integrated Razorpay for handling course payments. Enrollments are validated and recorded after successful payment. Sends enrollment confirmation email using Nodemailer. This project is a backend service for managing course payments and student enrollments using Razorpay for payment processing. It allows users to enroll in courses by making secure payments and ensures that each transaction is properly validated. The system uses MongoDB to store course and user details, while Nodemailer handles email notifications for enrollment confirmations.

+ 📚 Sections and SubSections
- Create Section: Fetches data from the request body, validates sectionName and courseId, creates a section, updates the course with the new section's object ID, and populates Section and SubSection using the populate function. Returns a response indicating successful section creation.
- Update Section: Takes input data from the request body, validates the data, updates the section data using findByIdAndUpdate from the database, and returns a response that the section is updated successfully.
- Delete Section: Takes sectionId from the request body, validates it, fetches and deletes the section from the database using findByIdAndDelete, and returns a response that the section is deleted.

+ SubSection Controller
- Create SubSection: Fetches data from the request body, validates sectionId, title, timeDuration, description, and videoFile, uploads the video to Cloudinary, creates a new SubSection, updates the corresponding Section by adding the SubSection ID, populates the Section with subSections, and returns a response that the SubSection is created successfully.
- Update SubSection: Takes input data from the request body, validates the sectionId, updates the SubSection data using findByIdAndUpdate from the database, and returns a response that the SubSection is updated successfully.
- Delete SubSection: Takes sectionId from the request body, validates the sectionId, deletes the SubSection using findByIdAndDelete from the database, and returns a response that the SubSection is deleted successfully.

+ 👤 Profile Management
- CRUD operations for user profiles. Fetches and updates details using userId. Handles getting user data, validating it, finding the profile in the database using userId, and updating, deleting, and getting all details of the user.

+ ⭐ Rating & Review System
- Only enrolled users can rate and review courses. Prevents duplicate reviews and updates course with rating references.
- Create Rating and Review: Retrieves rating, review, and courseId from the request body and validates them. Ensures that the user is enrolled in the course and has not already reviewed it. Creates a new rating and review entry, updates the course by adding the review’s Object ID, and returns a response indicating that the rating and review were created successfully.
- Get Average Rating: Retrieves courseId from the request parameters and validates it. Uses aggregation to calculate the average rating of the course. If ratings exist, returns the calculated average; otherwise, returns a response indicating that no ratings are available.

- Get All Ratings and Reviews: Fetches all rating and review entries from the database, sorts them in descending order of rating, and populates user and course details. Returns the retrieved reviews along with a success response.

+ 📬 Contact Us Feature
- Captures user queries (name, email, message, etc.). Sends confirmation to user and notification to StudyPoint admin. Data stored for tracking and analytics. Retrieves the user's first name, last name, email, contact number, message, and userId (if registered) from the request body and validates them. Stores the query in the database for tracking. Sends a confirmation email to the user acknowledging the receipt of their query and notifies the StudyPoint admin about the new inquiry. Returns a response indicating that the query has been submitted successfully.

+ 🛡️ Middleware
- Pre-save Hook: Triggers after an OTP is submitted, ensuring that the OTP is processed and sent via email before being saved in the database.

+ 📦 Utilities
- mailSender: Sends OTP and notifications using the Nodemailer package.
- validation: Ensures all email addresses, usernames, and other input fields are properly verified for accuracy. If any fields contain invalid data, the system returns a response prompting the user to provide correct details.
- imageUploader: Integrates with Cloudinary for managing the uploading of images, including thumbnails, videos, and lecture content, ensuring optimized performance and storage.
